      <p class="welcomePar">Food is medicine. Food and water are our body's means of survivial but immediate access to healthy, nutritious meals are very hard to come by. Not just due to the great distances that food travels before it gets to a grocery store <a class="links" href="https://cuesa.org/learn/how-far-does-your-food-travel-get-your-plate " data-bs-toggle="tooltip">[1]</a>, but also because of how food is farmed. Idustrial farming in the United States has posed a serious threat to our health from its use of pesticides and other chemicals that contaminate crops, land and waterways<a class="links" href="https://foodprint.org/issues/how-our-food-system-affects-public-health/" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">[2]</a>. some direct health issues that have risen from these contaminates include obesity, diabetes, and cancer<a class="links" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-food-additives-and-chemicals-harmful-to-children-2018072414326" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">[3]</a>. Additionally, studies have shown relationships with behavioral patterns in children in association with the food they consume as it's related to increased toxins found in our food system.<a class="links" href= "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749116327713" data-bs-target="tooltip">[4].</a></p>

      <p class="welcomePar">A major issue with addressing these issues, is that many people don't have access to food production. Farming accounts for less than 2 percent of the workforce in the United States <a class="links" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/farming-industry-facts-us-2019-5#:~:text=While%20farmland%20may%20stretch%20far,peaked%20at%20nearly%207%20million.">[5]</a>, and about 15% of all food in the US is imported<a class="links" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/importing-food-products-united-states/fda-strategy-safety-imported-food">[6]</a>. The industrialization of farming has indeed created a great disconnect between people and our food system, which has led to extreme waste in our production practices<a class="links" href="http://www.farmbillfairness.org/blogcontent/2018/11/17/american-disconnect-from-food">[7]</a><a class="links" href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">[8]</a>. While larger solutions should be geared towards ending industrialization, using hydroponics, people are now able to reconnect back with food and use this as a tool to reimagine our food systems.</p>

1. how can I change the color of the navigation bar?

<!--REWORD The overarching issue surroundng industrial farming and its effects is that because of the conveniences of food through capitalism, people are disconnected from and unaware of the immediate impacts these farming practices are having on our health. While the larger solutions to these issues will be achieved when we get our land back and have direct access to growing our own food REWORD, using hydroponics, we can start this process on a smaller scale to start rethinking about how we grow food, and have ownership and say over the type of food that is grown.-->
