    <h1>What is Hydroponics and Soil-less Farming?</h1>
      <p class="hydrotext">Hydroponics is a way of growing food without soil! Instead of land, plants are able to grow in a water filled container. With a bit of maintenance, access to sunlight and proper nutrients, just about <i>anyone</i> can grow food <i>anywhere</i><a class="links" href="https://www.verticalroots.com/the-what-and-why-of-hydroponic-farming/" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">[9]</a>. Really, <b>anywhere</b>. From home closets<a class="links" href="https://medium.com/girl-with-plant/how-i-built-a-hydroponic-vegetable-garden-in-my-nyc-closet-89b2834f8fdf">[10]</a> to rooftop gardens<a class="links" href="https://www.brooklyngrangefarm.com/">[11]</a>, people are utilizing their spaces in bountiful ways to grow healthy, nutritious food to their own or their community's benefit<a class="links" href="https://www.miohmyfarms.com/">[12]</a>.</p>

    <h1>Growing Herbs at Home</h1>
      <p class="hydrotext">There are endless direct and indirect effects to both growing food at home and using a hydroponic system. Some of the more immediate advantages effect your behavior including increases to overall mood and creativity and reduction of stress<a class="links" href="https://ellisonchair.tamu.edu/health-and-well-being-benefits-of-plants/">[13]</a>. Plants also eliminate air pollutants<a class="links" href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2007/ps_3.html">[14]</a> and help clean indoor air by absorbing toxins, increasing humidity & producing oxygen. Not only do indoor plants enhance the overall appearance of a space, but make for a healthier, happier you &#128149; </p>
      <p class="hydrotext">The implementation of Hydroponic systems have allowed for people that don't have acres or even miles of land access, to grow food. This unprecedented move into soil-less farming makes growing food more accessible than it has ever been. Not only can people grow food in their apartments, but they can utilize space in newly imagined ways. Hydroponic farmer's can grow horizontally or even vetically, and can create systems based on water capacity and environment, making farming no longer restrictive in capability, but now a malleble process that can bend around the grower's needs, wants and bandwidth. This also allows everyone that grows, to become their own boss. On industrial farms, the workers do not own the land and are subject to rules and wages set by their boss, whereas growers of hydroponic systems own their means of production. </p>
