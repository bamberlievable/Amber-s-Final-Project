      <p class="kratkytext">A Kratky system is the easiest method to both grow plants and ease newcombers into hydroponic farming! Our DYI Kratky kits are a passive system, meaning you just have to water your plants as you would any of your regular plants at home!</p>

      <p class="kratkytext">The Kratky Kit is as seamless as it gets! The kits are designed to be attached to any window in your home making them both energy and space efficient. Made from pvc pipes, the Kratky Kit is very easy to take apart and reassemble. The color of the pipes allow for plants to take in light without drying the resevoir. The pvc pipes are also fairly light, so the structure will not hinder regular opening and closing movement of your window.</p>

        <p class="list">The Kratky Kit is such a seamless design, it makes growing food at home an instant reality. The Kratky Kit is a passive system, that only requires manual water entry and occasional plant and system maintenance making it the perfect system for first time farmers. After the pvc pipes are connected, the felt wicks are first placed into the net pots and then the rockwool growing medium is stacked on top. The seedlings are placed on top of the growing medium, sealed and positioned within their respective holes on the pvc reservoir.To water the reservoir simply fill either of the top ends of the pvc pipe-the water will filter down into the resevoir. Those will be the smae entry points to add in nutrients and check pH levels. After the net pots are placed in the reservoir, the felt wicks will soak up water that will trickle to the net pot, soaking the groing medium, where the seeds will grow from.</p>
      <img class="dyiKratky" src="images/kitIncludes2.png">
        <p class="list">The back of the kit has five industrial suction cups that will steadfastly stick to whicever window. Although sturdy, the suction cups allow for a simple dismantle, providing a lot of flexibility in deciding the perfect grow spot in your home! </p>
